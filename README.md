powernotif - a low battery notifier
===================================

yet another daemon - a power notification daemon.



The problem
-----------

On my NetBSD machine I use obscure X11 window managers.

And every often or so, I would forget to charge my laptop.

This would make my laptop unexpectedly power off mid-whatever I was doing.
